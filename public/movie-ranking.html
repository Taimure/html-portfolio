<h1>The Best Movies According to Taimure</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Ready Player One</h3>
<p>The visual effects are great! It really immersed me in the experience.</p>
<h3>Whiplash</h3>
<p>Loosely reminded me of my high school band experience. The exploration of what you give up to be the best is interesting.</p>
<h3>Baby Driver</h3>
<p>It just smacks!</p>
